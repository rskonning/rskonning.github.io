This program was created to help benefit a food pantry to keep track of different data relating to their employees and volunteers.  Admin had the most authority over the data with them being able to change most aspects of employee and volunteer profiles.  Some of the most useful features of this project are the ability to track work hours, keep track of community service for volunteers, and contact information like email and phone number. 

Key Features and Data Stored :

1. The ability to register their volunteers and recipients of Charity. They need to track:
       Last Name, First Name, Birthday, address, affiliation (e.g., company or organization), phone number, DOB, (if retired) , email,  emergency contact: name and phone, Last updated by field
2.	The Hours each volunteer works: Last Name, First Name, total hours (quarter increments)  and date worked
3.	Search -> Show the hours by Company, User, Court Ordered, Start date and end date.


For this project, I was project lead with my main role by advising and splitting out tasks for the group to complete so that we made deadlines.  I took on the role of getting the database to work properly with our Java program.  I coded the different CRUD commands to collect the data from Java GUI and update it to the database.  This project help me to learn SQL and how databases function.  I also learned valuable skills on how to work on a team and how to properly motivate people.  Time management skills were also a valuable asset I learned during the time spent during this project.
