Lunch 4 Four is a web application used for matching active users into groups of 4 so that they can meet and socialize over lunch.  The application uses Node.js as a javascript runtime environment and makes use of the Express framework to handle routes.  It grabs user information from mysql database to match users into groups and allows the user to make changes to their personal information.  The app uses the pug templating engine to create the front end of the application.  Nodemailer is used to send emails out to users when a new Lunch 4 Four Meeting is created.
